            <h2>Ideologies and Thoughts:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Jinnah is widely regarded as the "Father of the Nation" in Pakistan for his pivotal role in the country's creation.</li>
                <li>He was a strong advocate for the rights of Muslims in India and believed in the importance of a separate nation for Muslims to safeguard their interests.</li>
                <li>Jinnah promoted religious tolerance and envisioned Pakistan as a democratic and inclusive state where all citizens would be equal regardless of their faith.</li>
                <li>He emphasized the importance of constitutionalism, rule of law, and parliamentary democracy in the governance of Pakistan.</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>
                "Mr. Jinnah is incorruptible and brave in his ideas and acts. 
                He has a certain austerity of manner and of life which is in keeping 
                with his ideals. The Congress is largely responsible for the 
                creation of Pakistan, and the mistake of dividing India into two has 
                been proved by events to be a Himalayan blunder."
                <cite>- Mahatma Gandhi (Leader of the Indian Nationalist Movement)</cite>
